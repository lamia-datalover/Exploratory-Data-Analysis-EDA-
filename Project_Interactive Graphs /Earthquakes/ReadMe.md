# Situation :

The goal of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset to study various incidents around the world, with a particular focus on earthquakes.
# Task:
Getting to know the dataset and focusing on earthquakes around the world.
# Actions :

First, I displayed the percentage of different incidents around the world. Then, I focused on 
earthquakes by displaying their depth and delving into the mean magnitude per day. After becoming familiar 
with the information in my dataset, I displayed the different earthquakes that have occurred around the world. 
Additionally, I added a feature that animates the previous map by years. This means that the users can select the year they are 
interested in and view the various earthquakes that occurred during that specific year worldwide.
# Result :

This EDA was fruitful because I managed to display the most important information from the provided dataset, and I was able to provide a visual representation 
of earthquakes around the world. Please feel free to review the code and the results!
