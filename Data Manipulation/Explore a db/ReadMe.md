# Situation
Using the data from chipotle.csv , I had to explore the dataset provided and get the information about the orders.
# Task
Getting information about the orders from chipotle.csv .
# Actions 
The purpose of this exercise was to learn database exploration techniques, such as using 'groupby', and focusing on column details like removing the '$' sign from the 'item_price' column. Afterwards, I aimed to display specific information such as the average revenue per order, the total revenue gained, and a list of the most ordered items.
# Results
The aim of the exercise was to learn how to handle a dataset and extract valuable insights from it. This objective was successfully achieved. Take a look at the code in the notebook to dig deeper into the details !
