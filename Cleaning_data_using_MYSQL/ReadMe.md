# Situation
The goal is to preprocess data within a dataset addressing layoffs in various companies worldwide, employing a different approach from my typical Python methodologies.
# Task
Cleaning data using diffenrent SQL queries in MYSQL Workbench.
# Actions 
To clean the data, I followed several important steps:
1) Removing duplicates.
2) Standardizing the data by identifying and correcting any spelling issues.
3) Handling null or blank values by either populating them with appropriate data or deleting them.
4) Removing any columns that do not contribute to the project's objectives.
# Results
The data is clean and ready for use in your projects. You can take advantage of it and conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA). I've completed the initial task; now it's your turn to delve into it and enjoy the learning journey! Have fun!
