## The goal of this mini-project is :
To analyze the causes of attrition in IBM. By utilizing logistic regression and graph visualization, I've discovered valuable insights. Logistic regression was used as the variable 'attrition' being studied varies between 1 and 0.

The findings indicate that the longer employees stay in the company, the less likely they are to leave. Additionally, as employees age, their likelihood of quitting decreases. Younger employees exhibit the highest attrition rates, possibly due to their pursuit of different missions that align better with their preferences. It's essential to consider that many employees resign to pursue better salaries (real-world reasons).

Please review the code to see the graphs!
