# This exercise:
Shows the importance of heatmaps to visualize colinearity by plotting correlation matrices. 
This visualization helps in understanding the strength and direction of relationships between variables and can be useful for feature selection in machine learning or identifying redundant variables in a dataset
In my case I displayed the most important columns that should be kept to predict SalePrice . Take a look at the code to see what a heatmap looks like!
