# The goal of this exercise:
To analyze the 'item_price' column in the 'sales_predictions.csv' dataset, 
I selected this column to understand the significance and importance of graph visibility. 
The column contained numerous dates, complicating the analysis visually. 
Therefore, I converted it to datetime format to extract insights effectively. 
Feel free to review the code to explore the insights discovered
