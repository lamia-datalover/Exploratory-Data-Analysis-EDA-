## The goal of this exercise : 
Is to show the importance of paying attention to the distribution of the data , I used the IBM dataset ( that you can find in this folder)
and studied the distribution of the column monthly income, where I found that the very high salaries bias our distribution so
I chose to dig more in the salaries < 8000$/month . It's evident that the income of 2500 dollars has the highest density 
at 0.0028. Following this value, the curve sharply declines to 0.00016 before gradually increasing to 0.0018. 
Subsequently, it continues to decrease gradually.
This exercise was a good apportunity to keep in mind that shape of the curve in a distribution graph indicates the 
concentration of data points. 
Peaks in the curve suggest where values are more densely clustered, while lower areas indicate less frequent values. 
A wider or flatter curve signifies a more dispersed or spread-out distribution, while a narrower and taller curve 
suggests a more concentrated distribution.
