# Situation:
The goal of this project is to know the field that has most important rate of attrition
# Task 
Getting to know the data in the dataset that I provided in the folder and answering the question : what is the field that has most the important rate of attrition ?
# Actions :
To answer the question, I needed to familiarize myself with the dataset. This meant dividing my search for answers into three parts:

Identification of IBM Employees: In this phase, I provided an overview of who the IBM employees are. I presented information about their age, gender, education level, and travel preferences (whether they travel frequently or not).

Monthly Income Analysis: In the second part of the analysis, I focused on understanding the factors related to monthly income. I aimed to identify the fields or variables that have the most significant impact on income. This included investigating the influence of education levels on income and examining income disparities between male and female employees.

Attrition, Education Fields, Gender, and Job Satisfaction Analysis: With a foundation of knowledge about the employees and income, I proceeded to study the relationships between attrition, education fields, gender, and job satisfaction. This part of the analysis aimed to explore how attrition is connected to education fields, gender, and job satisfaction levels among the employees.

By following this structured approach, I was able to systematically explore the dataset and provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of IBM's workforce and their experiences.
# Result:
I concluded that Life Sciences field has the most important attrition rate ! Also that women are not predictible to quit their jobs unlike man that are more sharp to evaluate their job satistaation level . If you are interested in more details have a look on the code !
